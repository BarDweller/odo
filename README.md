# Notes on documentation


## Files and file directories

`chosen-docs`: List of docs which have been "chosen" to be included on the site from upstream docs.openshift.com
  - For this to work, you must "match" to the doc filename in https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/tree/master/cli_reference/openshift_developer_cli
`docs`: Where all the converted documentation goes
`default.md`: "Default" template when using docs
`index.md`: Where we list all front-page documentation
